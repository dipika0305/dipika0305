# About Me

Hi, I'm Dipika, a data-driven problem solver with 4 years of work experience and a passion for uncovering insights that move businesses forward. With an MS in Information Systems and a strong foundation in data analytics, business intelligence, and cloud technologies, I love helping teams make smarter decisions through clear, actionable data. I specialize in building scalable data solutions that transform complex datasets into actionable insights, driving decision-making.

🛠️ What I Do Best:
- Designing data models, developing interactive dashboards, and creating business intelligence solutions using tools like SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Looker.
- Crafting optimized SQL and Python scripts to efficiently clean, transform, and analyze large datasets
- Building and maintaining efficient ETL workflows in Snowflake, AWS, and Azure to streamline operations
- Delving into A/B testing, trend analysis, and business intelligence to extract actionable insights

🌱 What drives me?

I thrive at the intersection of data and business strategy, translating business needs into technical solutions and making data accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Whether I’m designing intuitive dashboards, optimizing data pipelines, or transforming messy datasets into clear, compelling narratives, I’m fueled by curiosity, collaboration, and a passion for turning insights into meaningful impact.
